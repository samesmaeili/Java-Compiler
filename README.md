# Java-Project

Compiler is a java program that reads in a text file containing java code.
The program then looks for syntax errors by using pattern matching. 
If any errors are found, they are displayed to the console. 

The compiler project consists of several classes. Each class has a responsibility in finding syntax errors.
Each class has methods and instance variables and conduct operations on the text file.
